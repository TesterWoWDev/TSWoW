# Allows specifying whether to automatically output type files
# for this module, needed to reference it externally.
# possible values:
# - startup: will build type files on startup (used by stdlib)
# - watch: will use a tswatcher to build declaration files incrementally
# - none: will only build type files with "build types" command
# default: none
type_generation: none

# Allows specifying modules whose types this module depends on.
# Mostly this isn't necessary to fill in, but doing so might
# fix issues with build type declarations.
